AEP Feature Engineering Labs - README
This document covers the next stage in the energy data pipelineâ€”feature engineering and correlation analysis for forecasting.
Lab 5.1: Feature Extraction
Filename: Lab 5.1 Features_extract (21jzele0450).ipynb
- Extracts new features from time-series data (e.g., hour, day, week, month).
- Highlights the importance of temporal features in energy consumption modeling.
- Constructs lag features and rolling statistics to capture past behavior trends.
Lab 5.2: Correlation Analysis
Filename: Lab 5.2 AEP_Corelation (21jzele0450).ipynb
- Computes correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman) between features.
- Visualizes feature relationships using heatmaps and pairplots.
- Assists in identifying multicollinearity and selecting relevant variables for modeling.
