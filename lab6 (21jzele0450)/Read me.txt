AEP Data Normalization and Encoding - README
This document covers normalization, one-hot encoding, and cyclic transformationâ€”key preprocessing steps for machine learning readiness in time-series forecasting.
Lab 6: Normalization, One-Hot, and Cyclic Encoding
Filename: Lab 6 AEP_Normalization_onehot_cyclic (21jzele0450).ipynb
- Applies Min-Max normalization to scale numerical features.
- Uses one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables (e.g., day of week).
- Transforms cyclical features (e.g., hour, month) using sine and cosine functions.
- Saves the fitted scaler object (`AEPscaler.pkl`) for use in future data processing pipelines.
