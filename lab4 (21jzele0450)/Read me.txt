AEP Data Preprocessing Labs - README
This document summarizes three Jupyter notebooks covering key data preprocessing steps used in energy data analysis for AEP (American Electric Power).
Lab 4.1: Missing Data Handling
Filename: Lab 4.1 AEP_Missing_data (21jzele0450).ipynb
- Identifies and visualizes missing values in time-series energy consumption data.
- Demonstrates techniques to impute missing data using methods such as forward fill, interpolation, and rolling means.
- Emphasizes the importance of maintaining time-based continuity in datasets.
Lab 4.2: Outlier Identification and IQR Filling
Filename: Lab 4.2 Outlier identification IQR fILLING (21jzele0450).ipynb
- Detects outliers in energy data using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- Replaces outliers with statistically inferred values to maintain data consistency.
- Explains the rationale behind IQR thresholds and their practical effect on data smoothing.
Lab 4.3: Introducing Holidays into AEP Forecasting
Filename: Lab 4.3 AEP_Introducing_holidays (21jzele0450).ipynb
- Enhances the dataset by integrating national and local holidays.
- Explores the effect of holidays on energy usage trends.
- Prepares the dataset for use in forecasting models by including binary holiday flags.
Instructions
Open the `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Ensure necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` are installed.
