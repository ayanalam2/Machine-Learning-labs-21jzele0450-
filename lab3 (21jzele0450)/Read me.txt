IN this labs we have understand about numpy and pandas how to use it how to install it using pip

# Introduction to Numpy module:
NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing, providing support for large,
 multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to 
operate on these arrays efficiently. It serves as the foundation for many scientific and mathematical Python 
libraries due to its speed and versatility. NumPy offers capabilities for array manipulation, mathematical operations, linear algebra,
random number generation, and more, making it an essential tool for data manipulation and analysis in fields such as machine learning, data science, 
and engineering. With its efficient implementation in C, NumPy facilitates fast computations and enables seamless integration with other Python 
libraries and tools. Its simplicity and performance make it a cornerstone of the Python scientific computing ecosystem.





### Introduction To Pandas Module
Here, we are learning data analysis. Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language that helps with data manipulation and analysis. It offers various data structures which help in the manipulation of data. <br>
One of the data structures used is DataFrame.<br>
DataFrame is used as a way to store data in a rectangular grid.<br>
Similar to how data is stored in Microsoft Excel.
### Installation
We can easily install this library using the terminal. Follow the steps given below to install Pandas:<br>
Step 1: Go to the Windows PowerShell.<br>
Step 2: We can install pandas with the help of pip easily. Head over to the directory where you want to install the pandas and fire the below command:<br>
__pip install pandas__<br>
This is very simple to install.
